# Java Project - Hotel Booking System
 
The objective of the assignment is to implement an online Hotel Booking System in a
household. 
The application contains the following classes: Hotel,
HotelRoom, StaffMember, and Client. Clients can browse the available rooms, and
prices. 
To book a room, the clients need to create an account, and are then assigned a booking
reference and their details are saved. 
The booking reference can be used afterwards to access their account or modify their details and/or room booking. 
Staff members can add or modify room descriptions, and prices. 
Staff members have accounts and passwords which they use to logon to the system. 
Every hotel room has a number, a description, a price and an availability schedule.
